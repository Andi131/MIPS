# MIPS
MIPS with C++ asm test generator
This repository contains a **MIPS architecture project** with:
- A **C++ assembly test generator**
- A **hardware implementation** of the MIPS processor
- **Verification and documentation** to support learning and development

C++ ASM tet generator:
- Exercise different instruction types
- Validate datapath and control logic
- Detect corner-case and pipeline-related errors
- Support automated verification of the processor design
  
Licenta_code:
- Source code and implementation files for the main MIPS project. This likely includes:
- Verilog/HDL modules implementing the processor datapath and control logic
- C++ source for the test generator or other supporting programs
- Other hardware/software integration files

Licenta_doc:
- Design explanations
- Architecture diagrams
- Instructions on how to build and test the project
- Any written reports (e.g., thesis or course documentation)

Licenta_verif:
- Simulation testbenches for verifying hardware correctness
- Test vectors or scripts
- C++ tests generated by the assembler test generator
